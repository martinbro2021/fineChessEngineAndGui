# fineChessEngineAndGui

just a hobby project (that went a little too far) to get into chess programming, learn java, learn server client application programming etc...

i added the .jar/.exe files for chess friends who can't compile the application but still want to play :)

have a look at the version file to hear the most recently added features

hope you have fun with this - bug reports welcome!
