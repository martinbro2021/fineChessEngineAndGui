# fineChess

Just a hobby project (that went a little too far) to get into chess programming, learn java, learn server client application programming etc...

I precompiled the program for everyone who just wants to play ;)

Have a look at the version file to hear the most recently added features

Hope you have fun with this - bug reports welcome!
